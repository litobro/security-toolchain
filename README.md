# security-toolchain

## Description
A compilation of security related tools placed in a Docker image. The image is based on ParrotOS.

This is a WIP and tools are added as necessary and as I find use cases.

## History

I created this with heavy inspiration from [precurse/security-tools](https://github.com/precurse/security-tools). In a similar manner, I was looking for a consistent, portable, modular, and current environment that would require minimal maintenance. 

## To Do
Add way more documentation on tools included and build/usage etc.
